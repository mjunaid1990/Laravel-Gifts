	<h4>E-GIFTS Card Specific Terms and Conditions </h4>
	<h5>What can I use the E-GIFTS Card for and how do I get one?</h5>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p class="amounts">This electronic gift card (“E-GIFTS card”) can only be used for purchases in stores within the UK. You can purchase one E-GIFTS card per order online at <a href="/">www.e-gifts.uk</a> and you can load any amount between £5 and £150 on it. It’s not re-loadable, and once it’s purchased, we can’t top up the balance or give you a part refund if you change your mind. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The E-GIFTS card can be sent by either email or text message and will be delivered to the email address or mobile phone number as specified during the purchase journey. E-GIFTS cards can’t be bought in or collected from, E-GIFTS UK stores.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>You can use the E-GIFTS card for full or part-payment towards any products sold within a store whilst the E-GIFTS card is valid. “Store” includes third party concessions and petrol stations.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h5>How does it work?</h5>
	<ol start="4">
		<li>
			<p>The E-GIFTS card must be presented at a self-service or manned checkout in a UK store. It can’t be spent online. The amount redeemed from an E-GIFTS card and the balance remaining on it will be shown on the till receipt, which you should keep. It is not a cheque guarantee, credit or charge card and no interest is paid on card balances.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>You can also <a href="#">check the available balance on an E-GIFTS card online</a> or by calling <a href="tel:03450757757">0345 0757757</a>. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The E-GIFTS card is valid for a period of 5 years from the date it was activated or your last transaction, whichever is later. For these purposes, a transaction includes both a balance enquiry and using the E-GIFTS card to pay for a purchase. You will not be able to use your E-GIFTS card after that date and any unused balance on the card will be lost.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>You should treat the E-GIFTS card like cash and ensure that it is kept safe until you need it. When you receive an activation email from us, you can use the E-GIFTS card. Once activated, can’t be held liable for lost or stolen E-GIFTS cards or any credit amounts on such cards, and we can’t offer cash or credit in place of the balance on a lost or stolen E-GIFTS card.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>If you don’t redeem the entire value of the E-GIFTS card in a transaction, the balance will remain on your E-GIFTS card until it is used again or until it expires. We won’t give change, nor will we exchange the balance for cash.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
